    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>TEA Networks / July 2022 - Present.</h4>
            <p>I have experience in Backend development, working with the
                Spring Boot framework. I have developed microservices that
                manages data flow, and have gained experience in areas
                such as Authorization, Logging, Monitoring,
                database management with PostgreSQL, Restful APIs, Open API and
                Actuator. I have also worked extensively with JUnit and Mockito frameworks for developing unit tests for REST APIs. I am well-versed in writing test cases and test suites to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase. 
                I have experience integrating TimescaleDB for efficient storage of time series data in microservices. I optimized data storage using compression and retention features. Additionally, I developed Restful APIs using protocol buffers in a .NET project to consume and process real-time data flowing over MQTT.
                I work with a dynamic team using an Agile strategy,
                aligned with weekly planning, and I ensure the integration of
                testing and frontend for the projects I work on.

        <li><h4>Softtech / March 2021 - March 2022.</h4>
            <p>	I was working in Softtech as a Citizen Developer. \\
                We were working on restful APIs to ensure screens for bankers. So they can easily manage bank customers. Screen design, front-end developing and HTTP requests were some parts of our job.
